<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project uses machine learning to identify the breed of a dog given its image.

The data used is from Kaggle's Dog Breed Identification competition.

Dataset: Kaggle Dog Breed Identification
This is a multi-class image classification problem, where the goal is to classify images into 120 different dog breeds. Multi-class classification is a powerful technique used in various real-world applications, such as Tesla's self-driving cars or Airbnb's automatic tagging systems.

In this project, we'll use a pretrained model and apply transfer learning to fine-tune it for our specific problem. The process is broken down into several steps, from data preparation to model evaluation and improvement.

## Built With

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

In this section you should provide instructions on how to use this repository to recreate your project locally.

### Dependencies

Here, list all libraries, packages and other dependencies that need to be installed to run your project. Include library versions and how they should be installed if a special requirement is needed.

For example, this is how you would list them:
* Transformers 4.8.0
  ```sh
  conda install -c conda-forge transformers
  ```
* OpenCV 4.5.2
  ```sh
  conda install -c conda-forge opencv
  ```
### Alternative: Export your Environment

Alternatively, you can export your Python working environment, push it to your project's repository and allow users to clone it locally. This way, anyone can install it and they will have all dependencies needed. Here is how you export a copy of your Python environment:

  ```sh
  conda env export > requirements.yml
  ```

The user will be able to recreate it using:

  ```sh
  conda env create -f requirements.yml
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/catiaspsilva/README-template.git
   ```
2. Setup (and activate) your environment
  ```sh
  conda env create -f requirements.yml
  ```
